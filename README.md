✨ Features
📄 Generate professional PDF payslips: Automatically create well-formatted payslips with employee details.

📧 Automatically send payslips via email: Send payslips directly to employees’ inboxes using Gmail.

📊 Read employee data from CSV/Excel: Easily import employee data from CSV or Excel files for quick processing.

🔐 Secure email sending with Gmail App Password: Uses Gmail’s secure app password feature for sending emails.

📁 Organize payslips by month: Automatically organizes the generated payslips into separate folders based on the month for easy reference.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to get up and running with the Payslip Generator project:

1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ephraim25-design/payslip_generator_project.git
cd payslip_generator_project
2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the necessary libraries, including fpdf for PDF generation and yagmail for emailing.

3. Configure Gmail App Password
To send payslips via Gmail, you’ll need to create a Gmail App Password. This is more secure than using your regular Gmail password.

Enable 2FA on your Google account (if you haven't already).

Generate an App Password by following this Google guide.

Save your App Password in a safe location. You’ll use it in the next step.

4. Prepare Employee Data
Create a CSV or Excel file with your employee data. Each row should represent an employee and contain information like:

Name

Email

Salary

Other relevant details

Example of employees.csv:

graphql
Copy
Edit
Name, Email, Salary, Department
John Doe, john.doe@example.com, 3000, HR
Jane Smith, jane.smith@example.com, 3500, Finance
5. Run the Script
Once your data and configurations are set, run the script to generate and send payslips:

bash
Copy
Edit
python payslip_generator.py
The script will:

Read employee data from the CSV/Excel file.

Generate a PDF payslip for each employee.

Email the payslips to each employee using Gmail.

📂 Folder Structure
Here’s how your project files should be organized:

bash
Copy
Edit
payslip_generator_project/
│
├── payslip_generator.py       # Main script that generates and sends payslips
├── employees.csv              # Sample employee data (you can replace this with your own)
├── payslips/                  # Folder where generated payslips will be saved, organized by month
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies for the project
└── README.md                  # This file with project details
🛡️ Security Note
This project uses Gmail App Passwords for secure email sending. It is highly recommended to use App Passwords instead of your regular Gmail password. App Passwords are generated for specific apps or devices and offer an added layer of security.

For more information on securing your Gmail account, refer to the Google Account Security Guide.

📝 How It Works
Employee Data Input: The script reads employee data from a CSV or Excel file. Each employee’s details, such as name, email, and salary, are processed.

Payslip Generation: For each employee, the script generates a customized payslip in PDF format using the fpdf library. The payslip contains key information like salary breakdown and deductions.

Email Sending: The script uses the yagmail library to securely send the generated PDF payslips via Gmail. It’s set up with your Gmail credentials and app password for a secure connection.

Folder Organization: After sending the payslips, the generated PDF files are saved in a folder named by the month. This makes it easy to track and organize payslips for each period.

🚧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, here are a few common fixes:

Gmail Login Issue: Ensure you have enabled 2FA and generated an App Password for secure email sending.

Invalid Employee Data: Ensure your CSV/Excel file is properly formatted with the required fields (Name, Email, Salary).

Missing Dependencies: If any modules are missing after running pip install, try installing them manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install fpdf yagmail pandas openpyxl
